              <p> Star House Music Festival is a great friendly competition with the 4 house groups of star (Stella, Ave, Nagle and Fay) 
                with the winning house to be Stella, who won every catagorey! 
                It is a great way for students to be able to sing, dance and be in a band with a large group of people and compete
                 againts thier piers. Not only that but students get to dress up, pick their music, help create banners and 
                 designs all for the Music Festival. I 100% recommend to go watch it, it is amazing.

               <p>The Swimming Carnival is great fun for competition! You are able to try out for all the events you
                 want and it isn't just swimming, you can also sign up for diving! If none of that sounds very fun to you instead you can just
                  dress up in your house colours and house theme and cheer on your classmates during the races!
                   It's a great day to compete, cheer and dress up, but you will probably loose your voice by the end of the day!
